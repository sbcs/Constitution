# Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

This directory contains documentation and proposals for all **Special Interest Groups (SIGs)** under the Stony Brook Computing Society (SBCS).

Each SIG is a focused community within SBCS with its own leadership, meetings, and initiatives.

## Creating a new SIG

Per the SBCS Constitution, a new SIG must:

1. Be proposed by a student.  
2. Have:
   - A **name**
   - A **brief statement of purpose**
   - A **proposed SIG executive board**
3. Receive **¾ Executive Board approval**.  
4. Note: SIGs formed mid-semester may only request funding starting the **next semester**.

New SIG proposals should be added here as a markdown file.
