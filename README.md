# Constitution
This repository serves as the official, version-controlled home of the Stony Brook Computing Society (SBCS) Constitution. By storing the constitution in GitHub, we ensure that all updates, amendments, and structural changes to the organization are recorded transparently and collaboratively. After all, we are doing computer science stuff.
