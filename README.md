# Constitution
This repository serves as the official, version-controlled home of the Stony Brook Computing Society (SBCS) Constitution. By storing the constitution in GitHub, we ensure that all updates, amendments, and structural changes to the organization are recorded transparently and collaboratively. After all, we are doing computer science stuff.

## Branch & PR conventions

### Branch name
- `amendment/<short-name>`
  - e.g. `amendment/eboard-roles-update`, `amendment/membership-eligibility`

### PR title
- `[Amendment Name] Brief description`
  - e.g. `[PR Avengers] Update Marketing Team Names`

### PR description
- 2–4 bullet summary of changes  
- Short rationale  
- Note any impact on elections, membership, or finances  

## Review & voting

1. Open a PR with the amendment.  
2. Discuss in comments (questions, suggestions, edits).  
3. Update the PR to the final wording.  
4. Hold a formal vote at election night (or another designated meeting).  
5. If it passes, an authorized officer merges to `main`.  
6. If it fails, close the PR (keep it for history).  

## Versioning

Use annotated tags to mark major states of the Constitution.

### Tag format
- `v<year>.<major>.<minor>`
  - e.g. `v2025.1.0`

### When to bump
- **Major** – structural changes (new roles, election rules)  
- **Minor** – clarifications, small policy changes  
- **Patch** – typos, formatting, non-substantive edits
